# Gas-leakage-detection-and-Alert-System
Many accidents occur in day to day life like explosion because of LPG leakage. Major harm is caused, if gas leakage is not detected early. But now we can detect the gas leakage using the MQ5 gas sensor. In this gas leakage detector, maximum parameter can be set accordingly. Such Arduino based gas leakage detector systems can be installed in homes, hotels and LPG gas storage areas. In this LPG gas detector, system senses the LPG gas using MQ5 gas sensor. This device will continuously monitor the level of LPG gas present in the air. While monitoring, if the value of LPG gas in air is within the set limit, the green LED on the circuit will glow giving a safe sign. And whenever the gas exceeds above the predefined limit then the Red LED will glow and buzzer turns on to alert the user. This Arduino based project will help in detecting gas leakage in the surrounding easily.
